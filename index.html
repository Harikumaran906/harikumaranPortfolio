                <p>Hi, <br>Myself Harikumaran Anandhan, an aspiring web developer currently focused on 
                    learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python (Flask framework). 
                    I enjoy building interactive, responsive websites and recently completed 
                    my first web-based game project â€” a digital version of UNO. 
                    I'm actively looking for internship or junior developer roles where 
                    I can grow and contribute to real-world projects. Always learning is inevitable,
                    so I'm learning and love to learn more. 
                    In my free time, I like exploring game mechanics, styling my projects differently,etc.</p>
